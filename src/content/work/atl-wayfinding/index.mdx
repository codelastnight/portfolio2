description: ATL’s domestic airport has long had the reputation for congestions. The new $55 million skybridges into the terminal was meant to alleviate this issue, yet no one seems to use them. Why don’t people actively utilize the new skybridges?

Client: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport
Context of Study: Wayfinding/ Travelers, Guests & Customers for ATL

## The Problem

The Atlanta's domestic airport built four new "Skywalks" from the north and south parking decks into the domestic terminal to alleviate congestion issues caused by people crossing the drop-off lanes. However, people were still using the crosswalks below when investigated. The CX team from the Airport asked us to investigate why. Our team was tasked with the wayfinding of the "locationally challenged"(those who are lost easily) user group.

# Desk Research and Framing

To start, our team started by conducting desk research to become familiar with the space.

eventually, we arrived at the psychology and science behind people who get lost easily. (This is a whole field of study!) The paper [Cognitive Maps: Some People Make Them, Some People Struggle](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417744521) by Weisberg et. al. describes three groups of people: integrators, nonintegrators, and imprecise navigators.

We were able to use this to frame our problem space.

Additionally, we used the AEIOU framework to plan our approach in how and what to collect data on.

# Ethnographic Study

[image of 3 things we did]

Our team took the trip onsite to conduct the study. We we able to gather both qualitative and quantitative data through three ways: observation, stop-and-ask, and formal interviews.

## exploration and observation

We observed the foot traffic coming in and out from the parking deck onto the skywalks, a collective ~20hrs of observing. This gave us quantitative data on where people were going and what

We realized that most people didn't travel between floors, and that people rarely come from the 4th floor parking deck in general.

## qualitative interviews

We gathered 20 stop-and-ask and 3 formal interviews.

# Synthesis and Analysis

## Journey Map

Ideally, the journey to use the crosswalks should be simple.

Reality of course, is not so simple. Even just traveling between these two short locations, there are many decisions being made, as shown from the "unhappy paths" below.

# Reflection

This project taught me a lot about user ethnography, the nitty-gritty of actually obtaining valuable research information. Just as important, this project taught me the importance of questioning the prompt itself, as often the reason why the client struggles is because of a focus on the wrong problem. In this case, the problem is not the bridges themselves but everything surrounding it. This project revealed the complexity of working with clients, who each have situations (budgets, office politics, etc) that constrain the design problem/space.

I wish we pushed the client to think outside the prompt. The problem wasn’t simply people magically unable to find the skybridge, but rather that the entire infrastructure of the building makes the skybridges difficult to access and uninviting. It is clear that a large part of the failure of the skybridges comes from the design of the parking lot and the drop off lanes. We knew that the problem was the lack of access to the fourth floor, so we should have been more aggressive in our solutions.

I will note that there may have been cultural or other external factors at play that we did not consider, but that was out of the scope of this project. This would be interesting to investigate further.
