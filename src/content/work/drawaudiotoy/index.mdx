Utilizes OpenCV Image Recognition on a Raspberry Pi Zero to enable limitless ways to draw composition.

# Research

Focused on toys for the project, I explored the concept of educational toys and interviewed the owners of Rhen's Nest, a local shop specializing in educational and puzzle toys for kids.

## Honing in on Music

Traditional music education focuses on physical performance, meaning only the dedicated few can participate.

Music education traditionally emphasized performance, excluding those who couldn't keep up. In contrast, composition doesn't rely on physical ability, making it more inclusive for a wider audience of people.

Keeping this in mind, a comparative analysis of competing products shows a product opportunity space in the physical music composition space.

## Beyond western music notation

I also took note of non-western modes of music such as the [japanese mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mode) which has a Pentatonic scale (5 notes per octave) compared to the western 7 note per octave. Of particular interest to me was the [Shakuhachi notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi_musical_notation).

The use of Western Classical Notation today is a highly contentious and controversial topic, with opponents declaring that ["Notation Must Die"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq3bUFgEcb4), or that the written score is an elitist ["cult"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA6mkg0KNco)

# Redesign

The form felt unresolved, so I went back to the drawing board. I wanted to call back to the classic machined wooden toys, rather then the lasercut method I originally used.

# Reflection

This project speaks to me personally, growing up I had learned to play classical music. However, in my later years I came to the upsetting realization that this knowledge was often useless in trying to apply it to modern music. I was fascinated with modern UX developments in music production, and also post-colonial critiques on western music theory. This project let me experiment with applying my own philosophy of design, alongside learning OpenCV, woodworking, and lasercutting.
