## my portfolio 2: faster-er, flatter-er, and lighter-er

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/af16bcdf-fb7f-4540-ab92-2b7dfb4ecae3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/starlit-taiyaki-0fef7d/deploys)

turns out i didnt need a CMS (i hate gatsby!!!) an d also netlify-cms depreciated like last year (wtf???) so im just ballin it with just `.mdx` and `astrojs` now.

also, do i realllly need a cdn? probably not??? (unsure.. lets figure this out later...)

update: the answer is NO!!!!! the very slight performance boost is not that important in my case, and makes my website way too brittle
